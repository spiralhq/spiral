## Introduction

**Spiral** is a decentralized platform designed for the **preservation, cataloging, and verification** of audiovisual archives. Our mission is to prevent independent, regional, and historical productions from being lost due to physical decay or bureaucratic centralization.

The platform is built upon four fundamental pillars:

      We use the IPFS protocol to ensure your files are replicated across multiple nodes, eliminating single points of failure.

    Each work receives an immutable record on the Solana network, providing proof of authenticity
    and integrity of the original file.

  A database optimized for searching directors, casts, and technical information of preserved works.

      A decentralized organization that decides on the curation of orphan works and the management of the network treasury.

### Basic Terminology

To navigate Spiral effectively, it is important to understand a few key concepts:

**IPFS:** A distributed file system where content is accessed by "what" it is (hash) rather than "where" it is (server).

**File Hash:** A unique "digital fingerprint" of your video. If a single pixel changes, the hash changes completely.

**Solana:** The high-performance blockchain network where we register the "birth certificates" (NFTs) of the preserved works.

**Metadata:** Information about the film (Title, Director, Year) that facilitates cataloging and searchability.

## Core Workflow

Spiral is designed to be intuitive, even while managing complex technologies under the hood.

1.  **Wallet Connection:** Access the system using your digital wallet (e.g., Phantom).
2.  **Upload and Registration:** Upload your work. The system generates the hash, pushes the file to IPFS, and registers the preservation NFT.
3.  **Storage Management:** Contract storage providers using **SpiralCoin** to ensure long-term data persistence.
4.  **Inquiry:** Researchers and the public can locate the work and verify if the downloaded file matches the original.

<Callout type="warn" title="Important">
  Spiral focuses on legally available works or those in the public domain. Ensure you have the
  preservation rights before uploading.

## FAQ

Common questions from new users.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion id='blockchain-security' title="Are my films stored 'inside' the Blockchain?">
    No. The blockchain only stores the **Hash (ID)** and the metadata. The video file itself—which is heavy—is distributed across the IPFS network. This keeps the system fast and cost-effective.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion id="copyright-control" title="How does access control work?">
  Spiral uses a hybrid mechanism. The registration is public for verification purposes, but file
  downloads can be restricted based on the legal status of the work as defined by the responsible
  Organization.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion id='file-loss' title="What if I lose my local file?">
    Since the work is on IPFS and likely under a preservation contract, it can be recovered through the network of nodes that have replicated it.
  </Accordion>

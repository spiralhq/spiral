**Spiral** is more than just a storage tool; it is a hybrid preservation ecosystem. We combine the trust of Blockchain, the resilience of P2P, and the performance of traditional Web technologies to create an immutable protection layer for cinema history.

## The Preservation Philosophy

A large part of the world's cultural memory is disappearing. Fires in cinematheques, chemical degradation of film stock, and lack of funding in centralized institutions create a scenario of imminent risk. Spiral was created to break this cycle.

### Resilience over Centralization

Centralized institutions are single points of failure. If a server goes down or a building suffers a disaster, the collection is gone. At Spiral, we follow the philosophy of **Native Geographic Redundancy**. By using IPFS, we ensure that a work does not depend on a single location to exist.

### Cryptographic Integrity

In a world of digital manipulation, how can you ensure the film you watch today is exactly the restored version from ten years ago? Spiral uses the Solana blockchain as an **Immutable Registry**. The file hash is the law: if the file changes by a single bit, the verification fails.

### Sovereignty and Access

We believe that preservation should be technical, but management should be institutional. Spiral allows each organization to maintain sovereignty over its archives while utilizing a shared infrastructure that reduces maintenance costs.

## Why Decentralize?

Traditional archiving systems fail in three critical points that Spiral addresses:

- **Scalability Costs:** Storing petabytes of video on private servers is prohibitive. The P2P model and incentives via **SpiralCoin** enable a distributed and sustainable storage network.
- **Legal Fragility:** Through Governance (DAO), the network can decide the fate of "orphan works" (where rights holders have disappeared), ensuring that bureaucracy does not destroy art.
- **Obsolescence:** Server links die (the famous 404). IPFS CIDs (Content Identifiers) are permanent and based on content, not location.

## When to Use Spiral

Spiral is versatile, but it was designed with specific use cases in mind:

    To digitize and create geo-distributed backups of fragile physical archives.

    To ensure their productions remain accessible for future generations, regardless of the
    company's survival.

  <Card title="Researchers" icon={<Search />}>
    To verify the provenance and integrity of audiovisual sources used in academic studies.

### The Role of "Cultural Piracy"

Historically, informal P2P networks (torrents) have been most responsible for keeping rare films alive. Spiral "formalizes" this behavior, bringing the power of P2P networks into an environment with **curation, rich metadata, and legal verification**.

## Technical Evolution

While the vision is focused on preservation, the execution is purely technological. You can read more about how we implement these concepts in the
